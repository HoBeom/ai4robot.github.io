## Synthetic Action Simulation Platform for Elderly Action Data Generation
  
The world's elderly population growth emphasizes the necessity of eldercare technologies and underlines the role of action recognition tasks to comprehend elders' activities of daily living. However, most public datasets used in human action recognition either differ from or have limited coverage of elders' activities in many aspects. Moreover, data acquisition of elders’ ADL is challenging due to the privacy and physical limitations of the elderly.  

We introduce **<font color='#644ca5'>KIST ElderSim</font>**, a synthetic action simulation platform that can generate synthetic data on elders' daily activities. For 55 kinds of frequent daily activities of the elders, ElderSim generates realistic motions of synthetic characters with several customizable data-generating options and provides several output modalities. We also provide the **<font color='#c27ba0'>KIST SynADL dataset</font>** which is generated from our simulation platform.

## Development
### Unreal Engine 4
We chose the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) as our main rendering engine for real-time photorealistic rendering.  
  
### Background  
We have modeled four residential houses based on their indoor measurements using Maya. The household background has become visually more realistic by using physics-based materials and the Post-Process Volume function of UE4.

### Character  
Fifteen subjects, including thirteen elders, have been recruited to sufficiently represent a variety of body shapes and appearances. Their body shapes have been captured from Kinect and utilized to design the body shape of synthetic characters in Maya.

### Motion
In ElderSim, we provide motions for 55 activity classes. Based on the Motion Capture data obtained from the subjects, motion data have been rigged in Maya. The motions for synthetic characters are then generated by adjusting the template’s kinematic parameters to those of each character and playing the constructed movements.

### Viewpoint  
ElderSim contains viewpoints reflecting eldercare applications. To implement the various viewpoints, we define UE4 splines that contain several vertical cameras and position these splines based on the user parameters.  
<figure>

</figure>
  
### Lighting  
To simulate the effect of sunlight over time, we utilize the SkySphere Blueprint function of UE4 and provide an adjustable time parameter in 100 levels to vary sunlight. Indoor light sources are placed according to lighting layouts of actual houses. Finer rendering effects are applied by the Post-Process Volume effect of UE4.

  The data are generated and recorded according to all possible combinations of options in ElderSim. The total number of samples can be calculated with a simple multiplication.  
  Total Samples=actions×subjects×backgrounds×viewpoints×light conditions×objects
*	**Various modality outputs**  
  ElderSim provides video resolutions and frame rates of up to 1920x1080 and 60 FPS, respectively. Modalities of **RGB video**, **2D**, and **3D skeleton** are provided.  
*	**KIST ElderS Dataset**  
  Based on the above developmental features of ElderSim, we generate KIST ElderS, a large-scale synthetic dataset of elders’ activities considering eldercare applications. KIST ElderS provides 462k RGB videos and 2D, 3D skeleton data, covering 55 action classes, 28 camera viewpoints, 15 characters, five lighting conditions, four backgrounds, and a single object.
