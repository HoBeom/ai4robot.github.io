excerpt: We develop AI technologies for Human-Care Robots

# What is AIR?
The AIR project began its exploration in 2017
to build artificial intelligence for human-care robots.
The official title of the project is 
"Development of Human-care Robot Technology for Aging Society".
The project is funded by the Korean gevernment agency,
called MSIP(Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning).

# Project Objectives
The project aims to develop artificial intelligence technologies
for socially assistive robots that can provide personalized services 
in the areas of healthcare, affective interaction, 
and cognitive/informative support. 
The target consumers considered are the elderly people who can maintain 
independent living but are generally weak and incompetent 
in some capabilities.

The technologies should be viable to continuously monitor 
long-term changes in personal preferences, health conditions, 
daily activity patterns and social relationships to better 
understand the elderly people in various aspects and make 
qualified reports to families or dedicated care givers.
